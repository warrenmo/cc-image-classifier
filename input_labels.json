{
    "classes": "Type the different \"kinds\" (or \"classes\" in machine-learning-speak) of images you'd like the model to be able to classify. Put each class on its own line. Think of each line as a separate query in an image search bar (such as images.google.com), so try to make sure there isn't any ambiguity in the class/line. E.g., if you type \"gothic,\" you'll get images of both gothic architecture as well as people who resemble members of the Addams family. Instead, you might consider typing \"gothic architecture\" or \"goths.\"",
    "num_photos_per_class": "Choose the number of photos per class the model will train on. Higher number = higher model accuracy in general, but also longer download time, more hard drive space used, and longer time to train the model."
